# Project-X 
Dinosaur Game i.e. the game that appears on Google browser when there is no active Internet connection on the device/system so users can play the game while whaiting for their internet to work properly.
Breif details about the Project:
1) INTERFACE - White background with a yellow sun at shining initially and a horizontal line on which a image of Dinosaur appear and Cactus plant .
2) HOW TO PLAY - The game starts by hitting the spacebar, The dino starts moving forward approaching the Cactus Plant as the dino reaches near the cactus the user must hit the ENTER key to make the dino jump over the cactus allowing the player to continue and jump over the next cactus . If the user fails to jump over the cactus and the dino makes any contact with the cactus the game stops and asks the user to restart again by hitting the spacebar.
